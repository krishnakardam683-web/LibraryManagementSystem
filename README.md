# LibraryManagementSystem
This is a Java-based Library Management System built using Object-Oriented Programming principles. It allows users to add, view, issue, and return books through a CLI (menu-driven system). The project demonstrates concepts like classes, objects, encapsulation, and method overriding. It helps in understanding real-world applications of OOP in Java.
